# Button-For-Button

Don't know what you want to do this week? We don't know either so less pressure for us. (*whew*)

This is a simple single web page that has a button that locates all events within 10 miles of the users location that are happening within the next week. Ten random results appear with information on time and event location, as well as a link to the event in question. Not satisfied? Click the button again to get another ten results. Good luck and may the odds be ever in your favor!
