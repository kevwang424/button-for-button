# Button-For-Button

Don't know what you want to do this week? We don't know either so less pressure for us *whew*. 

Simple single web page that has button that can find all events within 10 miles of the users location that is happening within the next week. Ten random results appear with information on time, place and as well as a link to the event in question. Not satisfied? Click the button again to get another random ten results. Good luck and may the odds be ever in your favor! 

### Tools
- Foundation 
- jQuery
- Google geolocation API
- Eventful API

# Three Sentences
I am an expert at gathering information; sit me in front of users and business people and I can gather requirements and create a functional document that the developers can use to write their technical document and design the feature. While working on projects I came to the conclusion that I am not the greatest frontend designer; my professional experiences required me to use logic to troubleshoot, query databases, and etc, so I am much more comfortable with dealing with logic in the backend. My ideal project would be one where I would have the ability to split my time working  half in the backend and half on the frontend, it does not matter what the product is as long as I can do that.

# WHY??
I want to intern at Button because, as I mentioned before, frontend is not my strong suit but I am always looking to learn more and challenge myself. Although I am not great at something does not mean I should give up on trying to improve, that is just an easy way out. Maybe I am great at frontend but my abilities never shown through because I have not met the right people that would nurture and guide me through the best practices and standards. I totally believe that Button would be the right people (company, in this case) for me.
