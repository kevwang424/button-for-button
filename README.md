# Button-For-Button

Don't know what you want to do this week? We don't know either so less pressure for us. (*whew*)

This is a simple single web page that has a button that locates all events within 10 miles of the users location that are happening within the next week. Ten random results appear with information on time and event location, as well as a link to the event in question. Not satisfied? Click the button again to get another ten results. Good luck and may the odds be ever in your favor!

### Tools
- Foundation
- jQuery
- Google geolocation API
- Eventful API

# Three Sentences
I am an expert at gathering information; sit me in front of users and business people and I can gather requirements and create a functional document that the developers can use to write their technical document and design the feature. While working on projects I came to the conclusion that I needed to strengthen my frontend design skills; my professional experiences required me to use reason and rationale to troubleshoot, query databases, and etc, so I am much more comfortable with dealing with logic in the backend. My ideal project would be one where I would have the ability to split my time working half in the backend and half on the frontend, my ability to pick things up quickly, in addition to my problem solving skills would make me an asset to the team in little time.

# WHY??
As someone who is a mobile user I understand the frustration of seeing ads everywhere. With the case of a child, for example, by making something interactive, things seem less like chores and more fun, this is why I am onboard with Button's mission statement ("Give people actions, not ads"). During the last few weeks I have been working on my own projects utilizing different frameworks; Tachyons, Bootstrap, and now Foundation but I know I can learn more and hone my frontend design skills. Not only is Button giving users beautiful UI but those interfaces connect to a slew of different things. I am certain that Button would the best place to for me to grow as a frontend developer and allow me to show my expertise in the backend.
